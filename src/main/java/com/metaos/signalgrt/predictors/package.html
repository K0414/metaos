<h1>Numerical series predictors</h1>
All predictors should implement <code>Predictor</code> interface.
<br/>
For building a predictor ready to be plugged as listener to a source of
data, it must implement at the same time <code>Listener</code> interface,
from <code>com.metaos.datamgt</code>. To help in this task,
<code>PredictorListener</code> interface has been created.

<h2>Simple predictors</h2>
Simple predictors include the core numerical tasks. Should be implemented
in an agnostically way, thus, without knowning anything about the type
of data they are receiving.
<br/>
Subpackage <code>simple</code> has been created for housing these
numerical algorithms.

<h2>Specific predictors</h2>
Created for specific tasks. For instance, to predict volume profiles,
price changes, act as proxies of other values...
